## Description
A calculator that calculates simple interest given the principal amount, annual rate of interest, and the time period in years.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the repository's folder.

   - **Principal**: The initial amount of money (in your preferred currency).
   - **Rate of Interest**: The annual rate of interest in percentage.

The script will calculate the simple interest based on the formula:

\[
\text{Simple Interest} = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100}
\]

Where:
- \(P\) = Principal amount
- \(R\) = Annual rate of interest
- \(T\) = Time period in years
